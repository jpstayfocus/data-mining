## project

1. Diabetes is one of the most common and hazardous diseases on the planet. It requires a lot of care and proper medication to keep the disease in control. In this data mining project, this project teaches you to develop a classification system to detect whether the patient has diabetes or not. As part of this project, you will practice the usage of the classifiers that we have seen during data in class to predict diabetes for patients of a given dataset. You have to implement the three classifiers in Python and to validate them using the provided diabetes dataset by following the four steps that are described in 2).

2. Tasks

Step 1. Choose three of the following classifiers to use them for the prediction of diabetes:
 - Decision Trees
 - Na√Øve Bayes
 - Neural Networks
 - K-Nearest neighbors
 - Support Vector machine

The choice of three classifiers should be justified.

Step 2. Assess the chosen three classifier in Step 1). The principle is to compare between
the three classifiers and to use the concept of model validation seen in the assignment 2.
The overfitting problem should be taken into consideration during the experiments. A section of experimental results must be added and detailed. You can support your
arguments with curves and scores.

Step 3. Possibility to increase the scores. You have to check the possibility to increase the
obtained scores in Step 2. Innovation in the experiment to improve the obtained scores will
be an asset.

Step 4. A conclusion has to be added at the end. It should mention what was achieved in
this final project, drawbacks, and the possibility of the improvement of the obtained results.
